# Ale - Personal finances

Allows you to track daily expenses and declare income. Goals and Wealth tracking is up to be implemented.

The intention for this app is to be built and fully maintained only through an AI-native software development approach

So far the application started from https://bolt.new but continued through Cline in VS Code mainly with Claude Sonnet 3.5. Tried DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI 4o in the process as well.

Result so far:

- Next.js application
- Supabase integration
- Authentication
- Email notifications on certain conditions with API routes and Resend integration
- PWA support
- Responsive UI
